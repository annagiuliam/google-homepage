This is my very first project.
I will clone the Google homepage.
Goals:
- Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
- Center an element horizontally
- Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
- Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
